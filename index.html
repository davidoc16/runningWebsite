  <h2>10 Components of Good Running Technique</h2><br><!--http://www.chirunning.com/blog/entry/10-components-of-good-running-form-->
  <span id = "bold">1. Flexibility</span><br>
  Flexibility is a must for good techique when running for your muscles, tendons, ligaments and also for your joints.<br>
  <span id = "bold">2. Good posture</span><br>
  Your running technique is totally dependent on your posture. 
  The efficiency of your running technique is directly proportional to the quality of your posture.<br>
  <span id = "bold">3. Good leg motion</span><br>
  Overstriding can be the cause of a majority of both hamstring and knee injuries. 
  Overstriding is when your feet land in front of you instead of landing under you. 
  Not bending your knees while running leads to stiffness in your legs and also poor circulation. 
  While running at a good, medium pace your knees should be bent at an angle of 90&#176;.<br>
  <span id = "bold">4. Cadence</span><br>
  The vast majority of people have a low cadence (the number of strides you take per minute). 
  When your running it's best to spend the least amount of time on your legs as much as possible. 
  The longer each stride, the more time your foot will spend on the surface of the ground, 
  and the more energy your legs will have to expend in order to support your body weight.<br>
  <span id = "bold">5. Body Sensing</span><br>
  Listening to your body is vital in order to prevent injury.<br>
  <span id = "bold">6. Good mental focus</span><br>
  Making changes to your running takes mental focus. 
  If you want to improve your running by running faster, farther and injury-free, you'll have to use
  your brain to re-eduate your body.<br>
  <span id = "bold">7. Good upper body/lower body coordination</span><br>
  The general rule for effective running is that your upper body and lower body should be doing equal amounts of work. 
  For most runners, this 50/50 ratio is tilted one way or the other. 
  When your upper body and lower body are working in unison rather than against each other, 
  it spreads the work of running over the whole body and takes the load off of any single muscle group. 
  It's similar to the principle that work is best done if the responsibility is spread out over many workers.<br>
  <span id = "bold">8. Good breathing habits</span><br>
  When your breath is shallow, you only use the very upper part of your lungs and 
  don't take advantage of your total lung capacity.
  Oxygen is what your muscles use to convert stored fuels into usable energy, 
  and any reduction in your oxygen uptake will effect your ability to burn glycogen.<br>
  <span id = "bold">9. Proper bend in your knees and elbows</span><br>
  The less you bend your arms and legs, the more work your muscles have to do when you're running. 
  An arm or leg that is bent at the knee or elbow will swing much easier than one that is straight. 
  As you approach your "cruising" speed, your forearms and shins should both be parallel to the ground in mid-swing.<br>
  <span id = "bold">10. Staying relaxed</span><br>
  This includes having a good sense of humor, observing what's going on within you and around you, 
  and responding wisely to those observations.<br>
